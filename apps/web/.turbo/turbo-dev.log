Error: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
    We couldn't find the Next.js package ([1m[31mnext/package.json[39m[22m) from the project directory: [1m[31m/Users/carefreelife/Desktop/CarefreeHub/apps/web/app[39m[22m
     To fix this, set [32mturbopack.root[39m in your Next.js config, or ensure the Next.js package is resolvable from this directory.
    Note: For security and performance reasons, files outside of the project directory will not be compiled.
